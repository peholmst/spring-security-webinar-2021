Wed Aug 4:
- How are new mailboxes registered? Whenever a user logs in or by an admin?
- How do you look up users when adding new mailboxes or giving rights to a mailbox?
- How do you look up the name of the user for showing it in the UI? The UUID does not say anything.


Thu Aug 5:
- Users coming from the looking service have empty IDs. Need to fix that.

- Show a notification if you receive a message in any of the mailboxes that you can read
